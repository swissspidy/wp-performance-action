# wp-performance-action

A GitHub action to measure performance metrics of WordPress sites.

Results are posted as comments to pull requests and as [GitHub Action job summaries](https://github.blog/2022-05-09-supercharging-github-actions-with-job-summaries/).

It collects data from the `Server-Timing` header and runs Lighthouse on a given set of URLs.
